# Clock
I created this analog clock using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
I wanted to display a clock on the main page of this site, however a digital clock seemed too easy.  
I am glad I made that decision because making this application taught me a lot about integrating javascript with css that I wouldn't have known otherwise.
